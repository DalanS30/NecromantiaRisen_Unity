You stroll into the tree-line beside your homestead, keeping a straight trek through the woods and towards where the glen lies. You've been there before many times, when you've played or rested beside the stream in your summer days. The stream has crisp and refreshing water, and the further you go into the forest, the thirstier you get. After a short time, you hear the trickle of the water reach your ears, and then it's there before you, the stream cutting right through the dense growth of trees. The sun shines down on the glen, bathing the plant life about it in golden light and making it look all the more beauteous. Bushes of the juicy,  dark-purple berries that are your quarry sprout up close to the bank. You bend to gather water in your hands, sipping at it before turning to the bushes. You pick many, until your basket is full. Your task is done, but you feel like resting a while by the stream; the sun's still high and the day is yours. Will you go back to your shack and prepare for supper, or will you stay and rest for a bit?
