You decide to be extra adventurous today, walking into the tree-line beside your homestead and gradually turning towards the west, where the cave lies. It's set into the face of some rocky outcroppings a short distance from your home, and it's just big and wide enough for a grown man to enter into. Although it fascinates you, you've never gone very deep into its cavern; your young fancies have decided it could be haunted, or perhaps be the home of some strange beast. After a short walk, you come upon the rocky terrain and spy the dark mouth of the cave, where bushes of the juicy, dark-purple berries that are your quarry grow. You approach the cave with caution, imagining the berries are treasure that you, a bold warrior, must snatch from the dragon that slumbers within the cave. You dash to the bushes and pick the berries as your fantasy plays out in your head; you've won your treasure without encountering the beast. Now that your task is done, you start to wonder: should you get on back home and prepare for supper, or be bolder still and go into the cave to see what, if anything, lies inside? What is a young warrior to do?
